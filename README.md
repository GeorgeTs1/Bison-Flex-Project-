# Bison-Flex-Project-
Bison&amp;Flex Project CEID


We made a compiler for a pseudo-language in C with Flex & Bison.

We used Ubuntu 20.04 for the implementation. 

The program is compiled when its finished and an indicated error message is shown if the syntax or some exception is occured.Examples are shown in the screenshots above.

We decide to use indentation for each new command starting with two tabs for one command like (PRINTF,FOR...) and 3 tabs for nested commands inside loops.

The compiler supports functions,structs and basically follows the C language standart.
